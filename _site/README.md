# Hyde Plus

Hyde Plus is a fork of [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde)  which is a brazen
two-column [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that pairs a prominent sidebar
with uncomplicated content.

## Installation

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "jekyll-theme-hyde-plus"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: jekyll-theme-hyde-plus
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install jekyll-theme-hyde-plus


## Usage

Hyde Plus is a fork of [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde), a theme built on top of
[Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), which provides a fully furnished Jekyll
setupâ€”just download and start the Jekyll server. See
[the Poole usage guidelines](https://github.com/poole/poole#usage) for how to
install and use Jekyll. Hyde Plus can do more than what
[Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) can do.


## Options

Hyde includes some customizable options, typically applied via classes on the `<body>` element.


### Sidebar menu

Create a list of nav links in the sidebar by assigning each Jekyll page the correct layout in the page's [front-matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/).

```
---
layout: page
title: About
---
```

**Why require a specific layout?** Jekyll will return *all* pages, including the `atom.xml`, and with an alphabetical sort order. To ensure the first link is *Home*, we exclude the `index.html` page from this list by specifying the `page` layout.


### Sticky sidebar content

By default Hyde ships with a sidebar that affixes it's content to the bottom of the sidebar. You can optionally disable this by removing the `.sidebar-sticky` class from the sidebar's `.container`. Sidebar content will then normally flow from top to bottom.

```html
<!-- Default sidebar -->
<div class="sidebar">
  <div class="container sidebar-sticky">
    ...
  </div>
</div>

<!-- Modified sidebar -->
<div class="sidebar">
  <div class="container">
    ...
  </div>
</div>
```


### Themes

Hyde ships with eight optional themes based on the [base16 color scheme](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16). Apply a theme to change the color scheme (mostly applies to sidebar and links).

There are eight themes available at this time.

To use a theme, add anyone of the available theme classes to the `<body>` element in the `default.html` layout, like so:

```html
<body class="theme-base-08">
  ...
</body>
```

To create your own theme, look to the Themes section of [included CSS file](https://github.com/poole/hyde/blob/master/public/css/hyde.css). Copy any existing theme (they're only a few lines of CSS), rename it, and change the provided colors.

### Reverse layout

Hyde's page orientation can be reversed with a single class.

```html
<body class="layout-reverse">
  ...
</body>
```

## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

Your theme is setup just like a normal Jekyll site! To test your theme, run
 `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to your theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.

When your theme is released, only the files in `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass` and `assets` tracked with Git will be bundled.
To add a custom directory to your theme-gem, please edit the regexp in `jekyll-theme-hyde-plus.gemspec` accordingly.
